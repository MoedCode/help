use Django without server application

```
🔥 Ohhh now I got you! You want to access your **Django API** from **anywhere** using the **public domain**.

You're almost there! 🚀

---

### ✅ Here's How to Access Your Django App Publicly:
---

### 1. Stop the Server First:
Go to your terminal and press:
```bash
CTRL + C
```
---

### 2. Edit **`settings.py`** 🔑
Go to:
```bash
nano help_backend/settings.py
```
Now find this line:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = []
```
Change it to:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['c95de2abd422.8fd67979.alx-cod.online', '127.0.0.1']
```
---

### 3. Run the Server with Public IP
Now start your server like this:
```bash
./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
---

### 4. Check if Your App is Running from Anywhere 🌐
Now open your browser and try this link:
```
http://c95de2abd422.8fd67979.alx-cod.online:8000/api/
```
---

### 5. If You Still Can't Access 🚫
Maybe **CORS** is blocking your request.

Go to **`settings.py`** again and add this:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS += ['corsheaders']
MIDDLEWARE.insert(0, 'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware')
CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True
```
---

### 6. Restart the Server 🔄
```bash
./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
---

### 🎯 Now Test Again:
✅ Your API will be accessible from anywhere in the world 🌍.

Example:
```
http://c95de2abd422.8fd67979.alx-cod.online/api/send-help/
```

---

### 🔥 Bonus Tip (To Avoid CORS Allow All Origins in Production):
If you want only certain domains to access your API:
```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://your-frontend-domain.com",
    "http://another-frontend.com"
]
```
